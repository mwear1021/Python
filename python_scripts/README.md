# Python_Exercises

A collection of short Python exercises created to stay sharp with core programming skills and problem-solving techniques.

## What's Inside

Each script focuses on a specific coding challenge or utility:

- `count_vowels.py` – Counts the number of vowels in a given string.
- `count_words_in_string.py` – Calculates the number of words in a string.
- `fizzbuzz.py` – Classic FizzBuzz challenge.
- `list_deduplication.py` – Removes duplicate values from a list.
- `prime_checker.py` – Checks if a given number is prime.
- `sum_of_multiples.py` – Sums all multiples of a given number within a range.
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py` – Temporary file created by the code runner extension (can be deleted or ignored).
